## METASPACE provides an open platform for metabolite imaging mass spectrometry

METASPACE platform hosts an engine for metabolite annotation of imaging mass spectrometry data
as well as a spatial metabolite knowledgebase of the metabolites from hundreds of public datasets
provided by the community.

METASPACE platform is developed by software engineers, data scientists and mass spectrometrists
from the [Alexandrov team at EMBL](http://www.embl.de/research/units/scb/alexandrov/).
This work is a part of the [European project METASPACE](http://metaspace2020.eu).

## Open as public space

We do not hide anything. All code is open-source, the input format is the [imzML](http://imzml.org/)
supported by all mass spec major vendors, the metabolite annotations from the community datasets are public
and can be browsed or exported.

## How can I contribute?

Please read [our publication in Nature Methods](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v14/n1/full/nmeth.4072.html),
follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/metaspace2020), spread the word, and think of us while doing good deeds :)

- **Have high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry data**? Please consider uploading them.
- **Are you a data scientist**? Please feel free to the export the metabolite annotations to mine thousands of metabolites found in hundreds of community-provided datasets.



## How shall I cite METASPACE in a publication?

Please cite our publication [(Palmer et al., 2016, Nature Methods)](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v14/n1/full/nmeth.4072.html) and refer to [http://annotate.metaspace2020.eu](http://annotate.metaspace2020.eu).
