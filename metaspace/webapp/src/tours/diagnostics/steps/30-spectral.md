Here you can see the theoretical isotope pattern and the observed total intensities.
You can zoom in and out using mouse.

It is common to see observed intensities that are somewhat lower than the theoretical pattern due to zero filling of pixels where peaks fall below the detection limit. Sample intensities much higher than expected often indicate overlap with another ion.
