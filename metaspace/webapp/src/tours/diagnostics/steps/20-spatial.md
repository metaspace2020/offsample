The ion images of the first four most intense isotope peaks are visualized here.

This is useful as a visual check of the amount of spatial correlation between the isotope peaks and to check whether peaks are above the noise threshold (image quality may degrade when images of less-intense isotope peaks are made).

Note that intensities are scaled independently, otherwise every image but the first one or two would be very dim, making it harder to see the spatial distributions.
